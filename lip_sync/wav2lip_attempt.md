# Wav2Lip Lip Sync — Implementation Notes

## What Was Attempted
Wav2Lip was integrated as the lip sync stage of the pipeline.
268/268 frames were successfully processed on Kaggle P100 GPU.
Pipeline failed on the final ffmpeg merge step due to Python 3.12 
path handling incompatibility.

## Fixes Applied
- Fixed librosa.filters.mel() positional argument error
- Fixed face_alignment.LandmarksType._2D → TWO_D
- Fixed numpy VisibleDeprecationWarning
- Fixed basicsr torchvision functional_tensor import
- Fixed face detection to skip frames with no face detected
- Fixed temp/ relative path to absolute path

## How to Run (Python 3.9 recommended)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rudrabha/Wav2Lip.git
cd Wav2Lip
pip install -r requirements.txt
python inference.py \
    --checkpoint_path checkpoints/wav2lip_gan.pth \
    --face input_video.mp4 \
    --audio hindi_audio_synced.wav \
    --outfile output_final.mp4 \
    --pads 0 20 0 0 \
    --resize_factor 2 \
    --nosmooth
```

## What Would Fix It
- Use Docker with Python 3.9
- OR use VideoReTalking as alternative
- OR use cloud service with older Python version

## Progress Made
- Step 1 Landmarks: ✅ 100%
- Step 2 3DMM Extraction: ✅ 100%  
- Step 3 Expression Stabilization: ✅ 100%
- Step 4 Audio Loading: ✅ 100%
- Step 5 Reference Enhancement: ✅ 100%
- Step 6 Lip Synthesis: ✅ 268/268 frames
- Final ffmpeg merge: ❌ Python 3.12 path bug
